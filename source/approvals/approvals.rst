**Types of Approvals**
====================
* The **approvals** tab displays different types of request approvals sent by the reportees to the *administrator or supervisor / reporting manager*.
* The approval level depends on the *tenant settings*.
* LMS supports two-levels of approvals i.e, *L1 & L2 levels* under each business unit.

    * **For example:**
          * If the approval level is *L1*, the request is sent to the *supervisor / reporting manager*.
          * If the approval level is *L2*, the request is sent to the *supervisor / reporting manager and administrator*.
          * If the approval level is *L1 and 2nd Level Manager Approval (L2)* is checked simultaneously, the request is sent to the *supervisor / reporting manager* and on approval, the request is again sent to *supervisor’s-supervisor* for the final approval.
          * If the approval level is *L2 and 2nd Level Manager Approval (L2)* is checked simultaneously, the request is first sent to the *supervisor / reporting manager*, on approval it is sent to *supervisor’s-supervisor* and again on approval, the request is finally sent to the *administrator*.
* Email notifications is sent to users on approval/ rejection of *online resources, classroom trainings, assessments, needbased trainings, pre-work resources/programs or renew programs/resources* from the administrator and also mark an **copy (cc)** of the email to the reporting manager/ supervisor.
