* **The approvals are based on the following 2 scenarios:**

    * **Scenario 1:**
        * When the user requests needbased training, it appears to both the *reporting manager & administrator* and also receives mail notification.
        * Once the request is approved either by the reporting manager or administrator the request record is removed from both the accounts.
    *  **Scenario 2:**
        * If the user is not grouped under any reporting manager, the request is sent directly to the *administrator* for the approval.
        * No mail notification will be sent and the user must contact the administrator orally.
