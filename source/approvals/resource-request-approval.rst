* *The approvals are based on the following scenario:*
    * When the user sends resource request for approval or rejection, it appears at both *reporting manager and administrator* account.
    * The reporting manager gets the mail notification and if the request is approved, either by the reporting manager or administrator the request record is removed from both the accounts.
