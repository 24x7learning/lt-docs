**Certificates**
****************
•	Certificates are awarded to the users on completion of :ref:`online courses <online course>` / :ref:`programs <online programs>` *(AICC/SCORM/xAPI courses)* or the :ref:`classroom trainings <classroom training>`.
•	The certificate is either **default** or **customized** :ref:`certificate templates <certificate templates>`.
  .. note:: Default certificates are set at the tenant level, that can be either downloaded or sent to the users.
•	The administrator sends the certificates to either single / multiple users via e-mail.
•	The aim of sending certificates through mails, helps the users to access the course (or) training completion certificate anywhere at anytime.
•	The mail option is used only in case of users unable to download the certificates.
    **For example:** When the classroom training is attached to a certificate, the users can download the attached certificate on completion of the training or else the default certificate will be downloaded.
