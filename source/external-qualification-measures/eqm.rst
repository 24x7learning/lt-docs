**External Qualification Measures**
*********************************
* The *external qualification measures (EQM)* is a type of external training provided to the users (or) employees in the organization.

    **Example:** Advanced Trainings, Seminars or Workshops.
* EQM helps users to develop their skills in the areas outside their current field and also broaden horizons which inturn boosts thier career prospectives.
* In LMS, the EQM is managed by **Head of Training (HoT)**.
* The HoT is a normal user with administrator privileges, but does not belong to any business unit.
* The head of training (HoT) is set at the **tenant level** and follows **two-level approval** hierarchy i.e., only one user is assigned as head of training for one tenant.
* The HoT receives EQM requests from the users irrespective of the business units.
* The head of training cannot be removed, but needs to transfer the HoT privileges to another user.

**Procedure to access the EQM:**

* **Step 1:** The user must send the EQM request from the dashboard.
